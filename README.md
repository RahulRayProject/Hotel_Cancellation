### Overview

The ultimate goal is to provide insights and recommendations to reduce cancellations, optimize pricing, and improve revenue generation for both City Hotel and Resort Hotel.


## Assumptions

## Research Questions
1. What are the variables that affect Hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?
## Technique Used
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns, trends, and relationships.
2. Data Cleaning to handle missing values, drop irrelevant columns, and transform data types.
3. Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation of findings.
4. Report Evaluation to assess the performance and accuracy of the predictive report.
## Findings
1. Reservation Rate:-Comparison to resort hotels city hotels have more bookings its possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.
2. Booking Trend:-On certain days the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a Resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort Hotel rates.
3. Reservation Status:-The number of confirm reservations and number of cancelled reservations are largest in the month of August whereas January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.
4. Accommodation Rates:-Cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest therefore the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellations.
5. Cancellation:-In the Top 10 reservation canceled countries, the top country is the Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.
6. Mode of Bookings:-Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies,whereas 27% come from groups  Only 4% of plant books what is directly by visiting them and making reservations.
## Suggestions
1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing Strategies and try to lower the rate for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the Resort hotel is higher in the Resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on their room  prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January , hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month . 
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
